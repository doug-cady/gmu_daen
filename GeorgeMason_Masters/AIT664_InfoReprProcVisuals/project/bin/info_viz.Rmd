## Focus on 25 smallest countries by population and compare their freedom scores

## Freedom vs Suicide rate
##### There might be a weak positive relationship here. It shows that higher freedom countries have higher suicide rates. That's curious.

## GDP per Capita vs Freedom
##### There seems to be a fairly strong positive relationship between a country's GDP per capita and its human freedom score. It may be easier for wealthy countries to be democratic and enjoy greater freedom. Future work: this may be related to how long a state has been independent and whether it was an imperial power or previous colony (what side of the spectrum in extracting resources and wealth).
