# Welcome to my project folder for AIT 664 - Information, Representation, Processing, and Visualization

## The files herein were created as part of a course long data analysis project utilizing R Markdown (and other R packages - ggplot2, ggpubr, psych, etc)

## File Structure

- `bin` - binary R programs (and github markdown outputs)
- `data` - input data files
- `graphics` - plots produced as part of EDA or later information visualization
- `html_markdown` - output from R markdown as an html document
- `output` - cleaned data output that is used in analyses
- `pdf_output` - output from R markdown as a pdf file
- `reports` - individual project report submissions


### Thanks for stopping by. I have a few other projects listed here on github too, so check those out if you get a chance.
