# STAT 515 Final Project

Welcome to my git repo for the final project for STAT 515.  I fit a number of models - LDA, QDA, Random Forest on a police stops dataset from the Stanford Open Policing Project.  I also created a few visuals along the way culminating in an interactive juxtaposed choropleth map with the help of R's `sf` and `tmap` packages.

Thanks for stopping by!
